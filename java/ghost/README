Optimal Ghost
=============

In the game of Ghost, two players take turns building up an English word
from left to right. Each player adds one letter per turn. The goal is to
not complete the spelling of a word: if you add a letter that completes a
word (of 4+ letters), or if you add a letter that produces a string that
cannot be extended into a word, you lose. (Bluffing plays and "challenges"
may be ignored for the purpose of this puzzle.)

Write a program that allows a user to play Ghost against the computer.

The computer should play optimally given the following dictionary:
WORD.LST. Allow the human to play first. If the computer thinks it will
win, it should play randomly among all its winning moves; if the computer
thinks it will lose, it should play so as to extend the game as long as
possible (choosing randomly among choices that force the maximal game
length).

Your program should be written as a Java web application that provides a
basic GUI for a human to play against the optimal computer player from
inside the Firefox browser. The web page should access a server using
JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest object, and display the results using DOM
manipulation.

Please submit your source code, configuration instructions, and any
comments on your approach. Please also include a WAR file that we can test
against Tomcat 5.5.x on Sun's J2SE 6.0. Finally, in your submission email,
answer this question: if the human starts the game with 'n', and the
computer plays according to the strategy above, what unique word will
complete the human's victory?
