3685	<p>Financial risk is a function of the mix of capital sources used to finance a company and is assessed by looking at how net income responds to changes in operating income or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Just as operating leverage results from fixed operating expenses, financial leverage results from fixed financing expenses (e.g., interest). The more debt in the capital structure, the higher the interest payment(s). Larger fixed interest expense will cause net income to be more volatile in response to changes in operating income. The relationship between the change in operating profit and the change in net income is termed the degree of financial leverage. All values for this calculation can be found on the income statement.

3712	<p>Financial risk is a function of the mix of capital sources used to finance a company and is assessed by looking at how net income responds to changes in operating income or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Just as operating leverage results from fixed operating expenses, financial leverage results from fixed financing expenses (e.g., interest). The more debt in the capital structure, the higher the interest payment(s). Larger fixed interest expense will cause net income to be more volatile in response to changes in operating income. The relationship between the change in operating profit and the change in net income is termed the degree of financial leverage. All values for this calculation can be found on the income statement.

6456	Note that both the forward and spot rates are quoted. To determine the amount per ounce that the corporation will receive for its gold, use the forward contract rate, not the spot rate. The reason the spot rate is not used is that forward contracts are binding and must be fulfilled. Spot transactions must settle within two days, while the forward contract is a 60-day contract. After choosing the forward bid/offer quote, determine whether the corporation will receive the bid or the offer rate. Note that the corporation quoted a rate to buy gold at the bid rate and sell gold at the offer rate. Therefore the gain or loss from the transaction is the difference between the forward offer rate and the spot offer rate.	-11.84	0.050000000000000003

Corporation B's short-term debt is listed on one line as notes payable and current maturities of LTD. However, its LTD consists of LTD plus capital lease obligations. In addition to adding depreciation to net income in the numerator, other non-cash expenses such as amortization and depletion are also added back. Note that both statements of cash flows already include amortization in the same line as depreciation.</p><p> <img alt="calc2-8_hint.gif" height="38" src="++uuid++9c8ff0c1565b44cdaaf91e2cf161b280/@@full" title="calc2-8_hint.gif" width="444" /> </p>	5.5499999999999998	0.050000000000000003	<p></p>\n<p style="font-weight: bold;">Related Documents: <br /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href="++uuid++cf3926fb17c44fdc9104d2626bbeb99b" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation A Income Statement (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++86012ae1e92a43acad25cafeb8d6e509" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation A Balance Sheet (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++8c92f1d149bf4cadb16e6b7f69e60985" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation A Statement of Cash Flows (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++7eadafa3e55c4a849dde4776dab1837e" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation B Income Statement (pdf)</a>\n\n</p><p><a href="++uuid++ebc090b59de14d539036945f11be4407" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation B Balance Sheet (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++0fa37910eca444fb9f937b89340087c0" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation B Statement of Cash Flows (pdf)</a></p>
4828	<p>Fixed asset turnover focuses on how efficiently fixed assets, or plant and equipment, are used. To find the fixed asset turnover, find revenues (net sales or total revenues) on the income statement and net property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet.

6448	<p>Note that both the forward and spot rates are quoted. To determine the rate that the importer has to pay, use the forward contract rate, not the spot rate. The reason the spot rate is not used is that forward contracts are binding and must be fulfilled. Spot transactions must settle within two days, while the forward contract is a 60-day contract. After choosing the forward bid/offer quote, determine whether the importer pays the bid or the offer rate. Note that the FX dealer quoted a rate to buy euros at the bid rate and sell euros at the offer rate.\n</p><p>\nForward Contract = Forward Rate  x  Amount\n</p>	675990	1

4797	<p>To determine the cash flow to total debt ratio, find the net income and depreciation on the statement of cash flows and find the short-term debt and long-term debt on the balance sheet. Due to minor variations in how each corporation lists its information, Corporation D's net income is listed as net earnings and its short-term debt is long-term debt due within one year. However, its LTD consists of senior subordinated notes due to SEJ plus other long-term debt plus convertible quarterly income debt securities. Note that you need to use the figures from each statement's current year. (Corporation D lists its prior year first and then its current year.) In addition to adding depreciation to net income in the numerator, other non-cash expenses such as amortization and depletion are also added back. Note that both statements of cash flows already include amortization in the same line as depreciation.</p><p><img alt="calc2-8_hint.gif" height="38" src="++uuid++9c8ff0c1565b44cdaaf91e2cf161b280/@@full" title="calc2-8_hint.gif" width="444" /> <br /></p>	1.1499999999999999	0.050000000000000003	<p></p>\n<p style="font-weight: bold;">Related Documents: <br /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href="++uuid++3f1540a1029b4e27b917984654780107" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation C Income Statement (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++164a0cf7504c42859b8f19a652f4915a" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation C Balance Sheet (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++b05893a3a8244c55b50b2c768e9e173e" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation C Statement of Cash Flows (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++58329d281286478e914655fb61b9e7fd" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation D Income Statement (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++59d715671e8e4bac9e43ecdce0a1ece7" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation D Balance Sheet (pdf)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="++uuid++9c433ddb1eed4e05afe1cb10124afaa8" target="_blank"><img alt="PDF" src="++resource++hc.pdf/pdf.png" /> Corporation D Statement of Cash Flows (pdf)</a></p>

6455	Note that both the forward and spot rates are quoted. To determine the amount per ounce that the corporation will receive for its gold, use the forward contract rate, not the spot rate. The reason the spot rate is not used is that forward contracts are binding and must be fulfilled. Spot transactions must settle within two days, while the forward contract is a 60-day contract. After choosing the forward bid/offer quote, determine whether the corporation will receive the bid or the offer rate. Note that the corporation quoted a rate to buy gold at the bid rate and sell gold at the offer rate. Therefore the gain or loss from the transaction is the difference between the forward offer rate and the spot offer rate.	38.159999999999997	0.050000000000000003
